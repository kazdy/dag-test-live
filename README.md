## dag.test() example repository

This repository contains the code shown in the LIVE with Astronomer on 2023-03-07, showing how to use `dag.test()`.

### How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you are in an environment that has Airflow 2.5+ installed by running `airflow version` from your command line.
3. Make sure you are in an environment that has the [Airflow Amazon provider](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/amazon) installed. If you use `virtualenv` you can run the following commands:

```sh
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.5.1/constraints-3.7.txt"
```

4. Provide your own Amazon connection by creating a `connections.yaml` file based upon `connections_template.yaml`. 
5. Create an S3 bucket `live-dag-test-bucket` containing one JSON file named `order_values.json` containing the following JSON string: `{'1001': 301.27, '1002': 433.21, '1003': 502.22}`.
6. Run `python dag_test_example.py`.
